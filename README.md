Three-Wheel Omnidirectional Robot

This project implements a robust omnidirectional robot using:

🧠 Teensy 4.1 as the main controller

🎮 PS4 controller via ESP32 (I2C communication)

📍 BNO055 IMU for PID-based orientation stabilization

🌀 Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for smooth multidirectional movement

⚙️ Cytron MD30C motor drivers for three omni-wheels

Key Features:

Real-time control using joystick inputs

PID control loop for heading correction

Analog sensor integration for position feedback

Optimized motor vector calculations for omniwheel mechanics

Technologies Used:
C++, Arduino, Teensyduino, I2C, PID, BNO055, Cytron MD30C
